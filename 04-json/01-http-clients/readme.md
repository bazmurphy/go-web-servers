# HTTP Clients

So far, you have _probably_ been using a browser to test your server. That works fine with simple `GET` requests (the kind of request a browser sends when you type a URL into the address bar), but it's not very useful for any other HTTP methods or requests with custom headers and bodies.

## Debugging your endpoints

Servers are built to be used by clients. As you develop your code, you should be using a tool that makes sending one-off requests to your server easy! Here are some of my favorites:

- [Thunder Client for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client)
- [REST Client for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)
- [Postman for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Postman.postman-for-vscode)
- [cURL](https://curl.se/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

Use whichever client you like, _but make sure you're using one!_

## Why do I like Thunder Client?

Thunder Client is built into VS Code, so I don't need to leave my editor, and it's fairly minimalistic.
